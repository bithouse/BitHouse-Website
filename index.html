    <h1>The economic solution for Generation Rent</h1>
    <p>BitHouse is a platform that enables a property to be registered on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum Blockchain</a> as a decentralised autonomous house and rented in exchange for equity. In essence, it’s smart mortgage  and rental contract combined. The mortgage can be paid off by anyone who rents part of, or all the property and there is no limit to the number of equity holders. Equity is fluid, so there is no technical difference between a renter and an equity holder. Equity and capital are distributed dynamically through a central balance sheet secured through blockchain technology. BitHouse allows banks to provide a mortgage like service to dramatically more people while massively reducing the financial risk and removing the high administrative costs of repossessions. Creating a bridge for renters to become homeowners; A core problem for banks and society and a leading factor in the ongoing economic crisis.</p>

      <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>In many EU countries, there is a “Housing Trap” which burdens young adults.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Renting is too expensive.</li>
          <li>Buying is not an option because of the even greater cost.</li>
          <li>Getting a mortgage is nearly impossible.</li>
          <li>There is not enough social housing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This has lead to record levels of people between the ages of 18-34 living with their parents. In Portugal 58% of young adults live at home, in Spain it’s 55%, in Italy it’s 66% and in Slovakia, 74% still live at home.</p>
        <p>A typical young person in the EU lives with the knowledge that if they work hard, they still have little social mobility or opportunities to own their property. Worse still even highly skilled workers who move to industrial hubs like London, Paris or Brussel find themselves living in inadequate housing and struggling to pay rent. One in Four renters in London spends more than half their income on rent, and the average UK renter spends 39% of their income on rent. London is typical of many of Europe's major cities that are now at risk of losing their competitive edge due to an inability to house those skilled workers that they need to maintain the level of innovation that has defined them.</p>
        <p>Habitat.org in a <a href="https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/housing_review_2015_full_report_final_small_reduced.pdf" target="blank" title="Housing Review 2015: Affordability Sustainability Livability">recent study</a> concluded that:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/housing_review_2015_full_report_final_small_reduced.pdf">Based on the economic and financial growth and deregulation trends since the 1970s and the merging of housing finance into the general financial sector in the 1990s, our key diagnosis is that the risks inherent in the commodification of housing have eventually surfaced in the global financial crisis.</blockquote>
        <p>According to <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns_/why_we_campaign/the_housing_crisis/census" target="_blank">shelter</a>:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns_/why_we_campaign/the_housing_crisis/census">The latest Census shows that, in England, the proportion of homes owned with a mortgage has dropped by 15% and now stands at 34% of homes. The proportion of private rented homes has rocketed by 69%.
        <br/><br/>
        This historic shift reflects the growing trend in young people and families who are unable to find a stable, affordable home.</blockquote>
        <p>Even if the US housing market now looks to be headed towards another boom, there is still a lot of speculation as to how sustainable it will be. Some <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/duke20130308a.htm" target="_blank">government officials</a> are pushing for banks to once again relax credit restrictions, lend more and take on more risk to maintain the growing housing boom. But some of this predicted sustainability is based on young people entering long-term employment and thus entering into and maintaining long-term mortgage agreements. A prediction of the future labour market as akin to the pre-financial crisis market is short sighted because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The level of freelancers is set to rise dramatically. One <a href="http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> puts it at 40% of the US workforce by 2020.</li>
          <li>There will be a huge increase in automation. A study by The Bank of England <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/864.aspx" target="_blank">suggests</a> 15 million UK jobs and 85 million US jobs could be replaced with automation.</li>
          <li>An increase in remote working will create a new nomadic freedom for technologically skilled workers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this along with technological changes such as new forms of peer2peer networks and the numerous so-called "sharing economy " tech companies like airBnB and Uber will add increasing volatility into the labour markets. The notion of a "job for life" for most people at least is over. Increasingly this means that entering into an average 25-year mortgage is for most people unrealistic and perhaps even increasingly undesirable.</p>
        <p>At the same time, wealth is concentrating at an increasingly rapid rate. 62 people now own the same as the poorest 50% and the top 1% own more than the rest of the world combined.</p>
        <p>One of the leading factors in the increasing wealth inequality as outlined by <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum" target="_blank">Oxfam</a>:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2016/01/62-people-own-same-as-half-world-says-oxfam-inequality-report-davos-world-economic-forum">is the falling share of national income going to workers in almost all developed and most developing countries and a widening gap between pay at the top and the bottom of the income scale.</blockquote>
        <p>Housing is just one component of larger systemic problems within the economy. However, it could be dramatically improved using technologies such as blockchains and smart contracts. The concept of fluid equity does not replace traditional mortgages but instead brings new ways to manage risk, more choice and flexibility for consumers and an efficient way to redistribute wealth and improve the circulation of capital.</p>
        <p>Shelter is at the core of humanity's needs; The socioeconomic consequences of dysfunctional housing market are profound.

    <h1>Fluid Equity</h1>

<p>Fluid equity is designed to solve this set of problems by redistributing the means to production. The first implementation is within the property sector but it can be applied to almost any kind of asset.</p>

<p>What is created by fluid equity smart contracts is a network of ownership. In effect a network cooperative of housing.</p>

<p>An initial house contract is created by the owner of the house. The owner can set a fee which is fixed for a certain time period and acts in a similar way to the interest rate of a mortgage. And the seed can create rental contracts from the initial house contract.</p>

<p>These rental contracts collect rent, deduct costs and fees and distribute equity back to the renter. The fees could include a maintenance fee for a 3rd party who would manage the upkeep of the property or costs can be added by those who currently hold positions in the rental contracts themselves by consensus of house members. Because costs are deducted from the equity being distributed back to the renters themselves they essentially pay for their own maintenance and thus claiming costs only delays the return and the initial owner still receives her fee, keeps equity longer and thus profits more in the long run.</p>

<p>Within the house contract there are proposal mechanisms which allows changes on a consensus basis. Each proposal requires a 51% share of the votes to execute. A proposal has 30 days to reach 51% otherwise it is discarded. The weight of vote is determined by the equity held in the house.</p>

<p>Specific functions are voted on by the occupants of the house which allows for a very effective resolution of maintenance issue. For example if an object is broken in the house the occupants can organise for a repair or replacement and have the cost deducted from their earned equity in that month. Because costs are deducted from the equity being distributed back to the renters they essentially pay for their own maintenance and thus claiming costs only delays the return but an owner still receives her fee, keeps her equity longer and thus profits more in the long run.</p>

<p>Rental price changes can be changed by all equity holders by making a proposal. Because fees are fixed for a set time equity holders have a trade-off between raising prices to recoup their investment back at a faster rate and receiving less fees in total or lowering prices to recoup their investment at a slower rate but with more total fees. Fees can be changed only when a fixed term has ended and a change is proposed and voted on by equity holders. Similarly, a house can be sold be a proposal by being made and 51% vote being achieved.</p>

<p>Equity is released from all equity holders in proportion to the equity they hold. An agent can be both an equity holder and a renter. Effectively the longer you rent, the cheaper it becomes as you simultaneously sell, buy equity and receive fees.</p>

<p>The risk is dramatically reduced in comparison to a mortgage which relies on one or two people having a regular income for the entire timeframe of the mortgage. The consequences of a tenant failing to pay rent are low and the process of finding a new tenant vastly easier in comparison to repossessing and reselling a house.</p>

<p>The tenant also benefits in times of hardship as they may lose their home but they still receive credit in exchange for any equity they still own as their equity is sold back to other tenants. They can even choose to sell their share of equity to pay rent and avoid eviction. So the smart contract soften any rapid market changes and creates stability in the property sector.
</p>

<p>As stated in the Oxfam report one key problem in the housing market is that house prices are overvalued but it is not economically viable nor likely that prices dramatically reduce. If prices were to reduce to a more normal level it would create a lot of instability and push a lot of people into negative equity. With fluid equity the price of housing can remain the same and prices can rise as capital that was once going to landlords and letting agencies is distributed directly back into the housing market and converted to equity. So there is more purchasing power available in the property equity market.</p>

<p>In the future, all manner of appliances can be added to the contract. For example, a washing machine connected to the blockchain could arrange its maintenance and charge the contracts accordingly.</p>
